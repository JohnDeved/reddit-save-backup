# imgur-reddit-backup

- make use of github actions to scedule reddit api calls to my saved posts (no hosting required)
- make use of discord, google drive or github to host images (longer lasting alternative to imgur)
- commit links to a json file rather than a database just so it can easily be served on github (should not be big enough to require a db)
- create static SPA to view images on cloudflare pages (longer lasting alternative to reddit posts)
